## quick things
- [ ] everything should be brushable; fix brushable on multi tiles to no longer create overlapping copies of itself
- [ ] viewable color select for red is too dark to match the drawn color
- [ ] readable should have some horizontal text padding
- [ ] game settings ui formatting; include default zoom and use default items
- [ ] multi interaction shouldn't open multiple windows




## hard things
- [ ] auto focus certain inputs on dialog open

## might need some restructure things
- [ ] section buttons with arrow should be clickable on the text and not just the arrow
- [ ] undo button for viewable
- [ ] brush capabilities on eyedropper
 - [ ] switching tools doesnt always properly clear the previous tool (?)

## bugs
- [ ] leaderboard is wrong??
- [ ] placing something in the world doesnt update inventory checks until you move
- [ ] check file existence on copy + create
- [ ] copying a map and going to editor for first time always fails to load textures
- [ ] copying a map does not copy game settings; probably move from metadata to mapdata
- [ ] switching tools doesnt always properly clear the previous tool (?)
- [ ] copying doesn't load textures, or game settings
- [ ] game settings dialog requires two escape presses


## dialog closing
- [ ] picking up an item should close the dialogue
